<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Katie Curtis. I grew up in Gunnison, UT, in a big family with two brothers and four sisters. I love spending time in the mountains and enjoy anything that gets me outdoors. My favorite hobbies include camping, fishing, hiking, and, most of all, running. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of the wind in your hair, setting goals, and the incredible satisfaction of achieving them.</p>

<p>I married my high school sweetheart, and together we have three amazing kids—two girls and a boy—who keep me on my toes every day.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I’ve taken on many different challenges, from dental work to solar energy, insurance, and software. Each role has pushed me to grow, and I’ve embraced every opportunity to improve myself. I'm always striving to be the best version of myself and constantly seeking new ways to excel in whatever I do.</p>
